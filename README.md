# 📦 Supply Chain Management Analysis (Power BI)

# 🧩 Business Problem Statement
The organization aims to improve its supply chain efficiency by understanding procurement cost, supplier performance, lead time delays, and product quality issues. This project analyzes historical supply chain data to identify high-cost suppliers, defect-prone SKUs, and operational bottlenecks, enabling data-driven decisions for cost optimization, supplier management, and inventory planning.

# 🔍 Project Overview
This project is built using  supply chain data and visualized through two interactive Power BI dashboards. Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, KPIs were calculated using DAX, and business-focused dashboards were designed to deliver actionable supply chain insights.

# 🧠 Executive Summary & Key KPIs
![Supply Chain Dashboard](screenshots/Supply_Page_1.png)
# 📊 Key KPIs
* Total Procurement Cost: ₹1.73M  
* Total Order Quantity: 9,754  
* Average Lead Time: 28.71 days  
* Average Defect Rate: 3.09  
* High Defect SKUs: 136  
* Low Defect SKUs: 64  

# 📌 Executive Insights
* Procurement spend is concentrated among a few suppliers, indicating supplier dependency risk  
* Lower-cost suppliers often show higher lead times, creating a cost vs efficiency trade-off  
* Quality issues are driven by a subset of SKUs and suppliers, increasing rework and inspection cost  
* Lead time variability impacts delivery reliability and inventory planning  


# 📈 Key Insights
* Supplier-wise cost analysis shows uneven cost distribution across vendors  
* Some suppliers contribute higher order volumes without proportional cost efficiency  
* Ranking suppliers by total cost highlights high-spend vendors for negotiation focus  
* Supplier lead time ranking reveals vendors causing delivery delays  
* Monthly lead time trends indicate fluctuations caused by demand or capacity constraints  

# 🚚 Operational Insights
* Lead time varies significantly across suppliers, directly impacting order fulfillment  
* Location-wise cost differences suggest logistics and transportation inefficiencies  
* High dependency on select suppliers increases operational risk  


# 📊 Quality, Defect & Cost Optimization Analysis

# ❌ Defect & Quality Insights
* Identified 136 high-defect SKUs contributing disproportionately to quality issues  
* Certain suppliers show consistently higher defect rates despite similar order quantities  
* Defect rate by inspection result highlights quality control gaps  
* High defect SKUs increase operational losses through rework, returns, and inspections  

# 💰 Cost & Quantity Insights
* Order quantity vs total cost analysis shows volume increase does not always reduce cost  
* Product-type-wise unit cost comparison reveals inefficient pricing patterns  
* Some product categories show higher costs without matching revenue contribution  

# ⭐ Business Impact & Recommendations
* Optimize supplier mix to reduce dependency and procurement risk  
* Renegotiate contracts with high-cost, low-efficiency suppliers  
* Focus quality improvement efforts on defect-prone SKUs and suppliers  
* Use lead time trends to improve demand forecasting and inventory planning  

# 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
* Power BI – Interactive dashboards and KPI visualization  
* Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation  
* DAX – Calculated measures, KPIs, and business logic  

# 🔗 Conclusion
This two-dashboard Supply Chain Analytics project demonstrates how Power BI can transform operational data into actionable insights. It highlights cost inefficiencies, supplier risks, lead time bottlenecks, and quality issues, making it a strong portfolio project for Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Supply Chain Analyst roles.
